Chatbot 
In the modern era, handling personal finances is a crucial ability; however, it has become increasingly challenging for most people to budget, save, and make sound financial decisions. In response to this demand, I've created a chatbot named "Personal Finance Coach" â€” an AI assistant developed with Streamlit and the Google Gemini Pro API.
This smart chatbot enables users to communicate in real-time, posing financial questions on budgeting, savings techniques, debt reduction, goal setting, and more. Utilizing large language model capabilities, the assistant answers in natural language, providing actionable tips specific to daily financial requirements.
The chatbot was developed with a minimalistic and easy-to-use interface through Streamlit, which allows users to interact without any technical expertise. The Google's Gemini model integration guarantees smart and context-aware interactions, thus making the chatbot a useful tool for anyone looking to enhance their financial literacy and decision-making.
This project incorporates AI and financial education, demonstrating how generative technologies can be applied to empower people to create improved money habits and make more informed decisions.
